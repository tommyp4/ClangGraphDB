# ARIP Master Roadmap: Repository Intelligence Platform

**Status:** Active
**Vision:** Evolve the `graphdb` skill from a local Node.js script into a scalable, multi-tenant Go + Spanner platform (ARIP).

## 🌍 Strategic Campaigns

### Campaign 1: The Go Ingestor (Language Parity)
**Goal:** Replace the Node.js extraction logic with a high-performance Go binary capable of parallel parsing and embedding, with **strict parity for existing languages**.
**Status:** Completed
**Key Deliverables:**
- [x] Standalone Go CLI (`graphdb`).
- [x] Parallel file walker with Worker Pools.
- [x] **Language Parity:** C#, C/C++, VB.NET, SQL, TypeScript, Java.
- [x] Tree-sitter integration via CGO.
- [x] **Vertex AI Integration:** Embedding generation parity with `enrich_vectors.js`.
- [x] **Data Parity:** JSONL output strictly matches existing schema (Nodes/Edges).
- [x] Standardized JSONL output format via `Storage/Emitter` interface.

### Campaign 2: The Graph Query Engine (Full Query Parity)
**Goal:** Implement the "Read" side of the platform in Go, mirroring the "Write" side (Ingestor). This enables the Go binary to answer queries directly, preparing for the Spanner migration.
**Status:** Completed
**Key Deliverables:**
- [x] `GraphProvider` Interface (FindNode, Traverse, SearchFeatures).
- [x] `Neo4jProvider` implementation (connects to local Neo4j).
- [x] **Full Query Parity:** Port all critical query types: `hybrid-context`, `test-context`, `impact`, `globals`, `suggest-seams`.
- [x] Cypher Query Builder/Manager in Go.

### Campaign 3: The RPG Core (Intent Layer Structure)
**Goal:** Define the Repository Planning Graph (RPG) schema and interfaces. (Note: Initial implementation was a skeleton/prototype).
**Status:** Completed
**Key Deliverables:**
- [x] **Schema Upgrade:** `Feature` struct and graph schema (Nodes/Edges) in Go.

### Campaign 3.5: RPG Realization (From Prototype to Production)
**Goal:** Replace the RPG placeholders (Campaign 3 skeleton) with functional logic for Domain Discovery, Clustering, Persistence, and LLM Integration. (Note: Clustering was file-based, not semantic. See Campaign 3.6 for remediation.)
**Status:** Completed
**Key Deliverables:**
- [x] **Real Domain Discovery:** Replace `SimpleDomainDiscoverer` with directory/heuristic-based logic.
- [x] **File-Based Clustering:** Replace `SimpleClusterer` with `FileClusterer` (structural grouping by filename).
- [x] **Persistence Wiring:** Ensure `enrich-features` emits `IMPLEMENTS` edges and `Feature` nodes to storage (Neo4j/JSONL).
- [x] **LLM Integration:** Connect `Summarizer` to real Vertex AI client for generation.
- [x] **E2E Verification:** Verify a real graph is built and queryable.

### Campaign 3.6: RPG Remediation (Semantic Pipeline)
**Goal:** Fix structural bugs and implement the core RPG pipeline per the research papers (RPG.pdf, RPG-Encoder.pdf): per-function atomic feature extraction, embedding-based semantic clustering, and hierarchy navigation. Gap analysis documented in `plans/rpg_gap_analysis_and_remediation.md`.
**Status:** Completed
**Key Deliverables:**
- [x] **Bug Fixes:** Corrected `IMPLEMENTS` edge direction (Function -> Feature), fixed enrichment to cover all features with domain-scoped functions, populated `ScopePath` on child features, removed dead code.

- [x] **Hierarchy Navigation:** New `ExploreDomain` query returns feature + parent + children + siblings + implementing functions. Wired to `--type explore-domain` CLI.
- [x] **Cleanup:** Remove legacy `FileClusterer` and enforce semantic clustering by default (Plan: `plans/refactor_remove_file_clusterer.md`).

### Campaign 3.6.5: Smart Discovery Foundation (Ingestion Fidelity)
**Goal:** Improve the fidelity of file ingestion and physical discovery. This serves as the bedrock for the Global Semantic Topology by ensuring the "Universe of Files" is correct (respecting nested .gitignore) and that we have a robust way to identify physical roots.

**Goal:** Empower agents to perform ad-hoc graph exploration without predefined query templates. This introduces a flexible `traverse` command (replacing rigid queries like `impact` or `dependencies`) that accepts dynamic filters, directions, and depths. This capability acts as a functional bridge and verify-able harness for the upcoming Spanner migration (Campaign 6), ensuring complex traversals work identically on both backends.
**Status:** **Completed**
**Key Deliverables:**

### Campaign 5.2: UX - Async Embedding Generation
**Goal:** Address the synchronous blocking behavior of `EmbeddingClusterer` by pre-calculating embeddings with progress reporting before clustering begins. This prevents the "hang" during large domain processing.
**Status:** Completed
**Key Deliverables:**
- [x] **Pre-calculation:** Implement batched embedding generation in `main.go` with progress bar.
- [x] **Optimization:** Update `EmbeddingClusterer` to use pre-calculated embeddings.
- [x] **Plan:** Ref: `plans/feat_precalc_embeddings.md`.

- [ ] **C# Parser:** Remove path prefixes, use FQN.
- [ ] **Verification:** Clean IDs and connected graph.
- [ ] **Plan:** Ref: `plans/refactor_node_ids.md`.

### Campaign 6: The Streaming Pipeline (GraphProvider-Centric OOM Resolution)
**Goal:** Resolve Out of Memory (OOM) exceptions on massive codebases by transitioning from an in-memory batch architecture to an out-of-core streaming architecture. The pipeline will use the `GraphProvider` interface as the active working memory for intermediate states, enforcing the "Pointer to Blob Storage" pattern.
**Status:** Pending
