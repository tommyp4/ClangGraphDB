# GraphDB Skill Ecosystem

This project is fundamentally a **Gemini CLI Skill** specialized for navigating, understanding, and modernizing large legacy codebases. 

By representing your codebase as a Code Property Graph (CPG) enriched with semantic vector embeddings, this skill gives the Gemini CLI unprecedented spatial and contextual awareness of complex architectures. All interactions with the graph database are natively routed through the Gemini CLI when the skill is properly registered (e.g., by ensuring the `.gemini/skills/graphdb/SKILL.md` file is present in your workspace). 

The skill relies on a high-performance, cross-platform Go binary (compiled for Windows, Linux, and macOS) to handle the heavy lifting of code parsing, graph construction, and vector search. This allows the CLI agent to rapidly query deep structural and semantic dependencies directly within its standard execution context.

## 📦 Installation

You do not need to clone this repository or build from source to use the skill in your own projects. All necessary files and pre-compiled binaries are packaged into a single release bundle available on our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/jjdelorme/graphdb-skill/releases).

### Linux / macOS

Run this one-liner from your project's root directory:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/jjdelorme/graphdb-skill/releases/latest/download/graphdb-skill-bundle.tar.gz | tar -xzv
```

*Note: The extraction process preserves executable permissions, but if you encounter issues, run: `chmod +x .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb`*

### Windows (PowerShell)

Run this command from your project's root directory:

```powershell
curl.exe -sL https://github.com/jjdelorme/graphdb-skill/releases/latest/download/graphdb-skill-bundle.tar.gz -o bundle.tar.gz; tar.exe -xzvf bundle.tar.gz; del bundle.tar.gz
```

This downloads and extracts the `.gemini/` directory structure directly into your project, instantly registering the `SKILL.md` definitions, the specialized agents, and the compiled Go binary.

### Pre-releases (Beta)

If you want to try the latest beta features (or if the `latest` stable release does not yet include the bundle), you must specify the exact version tag instead of `latest` in the download URL. 

For example, to install `v0.2.0-beta.3` on Linux/macOS:

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/jjdelorme/graphdb-skill/releases/download/v0.2.0-beta.3/graphdb-skill-bundle.tar.gz | tar -xzv
```

**(For Windows PowerShell users):**
```powershell
curl.exe -sL https://github.com/jjdelorme/graphdb-skill/releases/download/v0.2.0-beta.3/graphdb-skill-bundle.tar.gz -o bundle.tar.gz; tar.exe -xzvf bundle.tar.gz; del bundle.tar.gz
```

## ⚙️ Configuration & Credentials

Before using the skill, you must create a `.env` file in your project root. This file is critical setup as it contains your credentials for configuring the Neo4j database connection, the embedding models for vector search, and the LLMs for semantic clustering.

```ini
# Neo4j Configuration
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# Google Cloud / AI Configuration (For Embeddings and RPG Extraction)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your_project_id
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
GEMINI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=gemini-embedding-001
GEMINI_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=768
```

## 🗄️ Neo4j Database Setup

The Code Property Graph is stored in a Neo4j database. To automate the database lifecycle, the installation bundle includes the **`neo4j-manager`** skill.

You don't need to run manual container scripts or commands. Simply ask the Gemini CLI to:
*   "Start the local Neo4j container"
*   "List my available databases"
*   "Switch to the 'LegacyProject' database"

The manager automatically configures the required APOC plugins and vector index settings (Neo4j v5.11+) needed by the GraphDB skill.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration

This project is designed to integrate seamlessly with the [plan-commands](https://github.com/jjdelorme/plan-commands) orchestration framework. 

While the GraphDB Skill can be used as a standalone tool, we highly recommend using it alongside a structured multi-agent orchestration pattern. When combined with the **Protocol Lifecycle** defined by `plan-commands`, the system becomes capable of handling complex, multi-step modernization tasks self-correctingly. For more details on using the Protocol Lifecycle, please refer to the `plan-commands` documentation.

### The Scout Agent

To support this ecosystem, we provide a specialized **Scout** agent (located in `.gemini/agents/scout.md`). 

Within the `plan-commands` lifecycle, the Scout acts as the primary "Researcher" during the strategy phase. Instead of relying purely on brute-force text search, the Scout natively leverages this GraphDB skill to:
*   Map deep architectural dependencies.
*   Identify global state usage across the codebase.
*   Find architectural "seams" for safe refactoring.

*Note: Enabling the full multi-agent orchestration is highly recommended for large refactoring campaigns, but it is not required to use the GraphDB functionality.*

## 🛠️ Build & Ingestion Workflow

To analyze a codebase, you must first ingest it into the Graph Database. Run these commands from the **project root**:

1.  **Extract Graph Data** (Parses source code, generates embeddings, outputs JSONL):
    ```bash
    .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb ingest -dir <target-dir> -nodes graph_data/nodes.jsonl -edges graph_data/edges.jsonl
    ```

2. **Build RPG Features** (Groups functions into semantic features using LLM):
    *   *Deep Dive:* [Clustering & Domain Discovery Logic](plans/RPG_CLUSTERING.md)

    ```bash

    .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb enrich-features -dir <target-dir> -input graph.jsonl -output rpg.jsonl

    ```

    Flags: `--mock-embedding` for dry runs.

3.  **Import to Neo4j** (Loads JSONL into the database):
    ```bash
    .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb import -input graph_data/nodes.jsonl -clean
    .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb import -input graph_data/rpg.jsonl
    ```

## 🔍 Usage & Analysis

The project follows a **"Graph-First"** workflow powered by the **`graphdb` Go binary**. It provides a unified interface for structural (Neo4j), semantic (Vector Embeddings), and intent-based (RPG) analysis.

### Query Commands

All queries use the same pattern: `.gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb query -type <type> [options]`

*   **Intent-Based Search (RPG):** Find where a concept lives in the codebase.
    ```bash
    .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb query -type search-features -target "authentication"
    ```
*   **Explore Feature Hierarchy:** Navigate the RPG domain/feature tree.
    ```bash
    .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb query -type explore-domain -target "domain-rpg"
    ```
*   **Dependency Analysis:** Determine what a function depends on.
    ```bash
    .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb query -type neighbors -target "function_name"
    ```
*   **Impact Analysis:** Find upstream callers affected by a change.
    ```bash
    .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb query -type impact -target "function_name" -depth 3
    ```
*   **Hybrid Context:** Combine structural dependencies with semantic similarity.
    ```bash
    .gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb query -type hybrid-context -target "function_name"
    ```
*   **Other query types:** `search-similar`, `globals`, `seams`, `fetch-source`, `locate-usage`.

### Text Search (Fallback)
Use standard `search_file_content` (Ripgrep) **ONLY** when the `graphdb` skill cannot provide the necessary data (e.g., searching for non-code assets or literal TODOs).

## 🕵️ Agent Execution Tracing

To understand the complex interactions between agents (e.g., CLI -> Supervisor -> Engineer), the project includes a configured execution tracer.

*   **Log File:** `.gemini/execution-trace.jsonl`
*   **Mechanism:** A hook script (`.gemini/hooks/agent-tracer.js`) intercepts `BeforeAgent`, `AfterAgent`, `BeforeTool`, and `AfterTool` events.
*   **Purpose:**
    *   Visualize the call stack of nested agents.
    *   Debug "Human in the Loop" interactions (e.g., does the stack unwind or pause?).
    *   Audit tool usage and arguments in real-time.

### 📊 Trace Viewer

A lightweight, single-file HTML viewer is included to visualize the trace logs.

1.  **Start Server:** (Optional but recommended for browser compatibility)
    ```bash
    # Option A: Node.js
    npx http-server .
    # Option B: Python
    python3 -m http.server 8080
    ```
2.  **Open:** Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/trace-viewer.html` (or open the file directly in a modern browser).
3.  **Load:** Drag & Drop `.gemini/execution-trace.jsonl` onto the page.
4.  **Analyze:** Filter by session or file to see the chronological lineage of agent operations.

To disable tracing, remove the `hooks` section from `.gemini/settings.json`.
