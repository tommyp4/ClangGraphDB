# Graph Database Skill (Go-Powered)

You are an expert in analyzing the project's architecture using a high-performance Code Property Graph (CPG) built with Go and Neo4j.
Your goal is to answer questions about dependencies, seams, testing contexts, and architectural risks using both structural analysis and the RPG (Repository Planning Graph) Intent Layer.

## Tool Usage
You will use the `graphdb` Go binary directly. Always execute commands from the **project root directory**.

**Binary Location Selection:**
*   **Linux/macOS:** `.gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb`
*   **Windows:** `.gemini/skills/graphdb/scripts/graphdb-win.exe`

**Variable Definition:**
Define `${graphdb_bin}` as the path to the binary appropriate for the current operating system.

**Base Command:** `${graphdb_bin} <command> [options]`

## Setup & Infrastructure

### Installation
The skill relies on a pre-compiled Go binary (`${graphdb_bin}`).
If it does not exist, build it from the project root: `make build` (Linux/macOS) or use the cross-compilation script for Windows.

### Environment Variables
The tool automatically inherits the following environment variables. Assume they are already configured correctly. Do not manually verify, echo, or debug these variables unless the tool explicitly fails with a configuration error.
*   `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD` (Required for `import` and `query`)
*   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` (Required for Vertex AI embeddings)
*   `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION` (Default: `us-central1`)

## Workflows

### 1. Ingestion Pipeline
To ensure the graph reflects the current state of the codebase, follow these steps:

**Step 0: Check Sync Status (Recommended)**
Before starting a full rebuild, verify if the graph is already in sync with your local checkout.
1. Get local commit: `git rev-parse HEAD`
2. Get graph commit: `${graphdb_bin} query -type status`
3. **Decision:** If the commit hashes match, you can **skip** the ingestion pipeline and proceed directly to "Analysis & Querying".

**Step 1: Ingest (Parse & Embed):**
Scans code, generates embeddings, and creates a graph JSONL file.
```bash
${graphdb_bin} ingest -dir . -output graph.jsonl
```
*   *Options:*
    *   `-workers`: Concurrency level (default: 4).
    *   `-file-list`: Process specific files from a list.
    *   `-nodes` / `-edges`: Generate separate files for nodes and edges instead of a single output.

**Step 2: Enrich (Build Intent Layer):**
Groups code into high-level features (RPG) using LLMs.
```bash
${graphdb_bin} enrich-features -input graph.jsonl -output rpg.jsonl -cluster-mode semantic
```
*   *Options:* `-cluster-mode` (`file` or `semantic`).

**Step 3: Import (Load to Neo4j):**
Loads the generated JSONL files into the active Neo4j database.
```bash
${graphdb_bin} import -input graph.jsonl -clean
# OR Split Files
${graphdb_bin} import -nodes nodes.jsonl -edges edges.jsonl -clean
```
*   *Options:* `-clean` (wipe DB first), `-batch-size`.

### 2. Analysis & Querying
The primary way to interact with the graph is via the `query` command.

**Base Syntax:**
```bash
${graphdb_bin} query -type <type> -target "<search_term>" [options]
```

#### Supported Languages
*   **C# / .NET:** `.cs`, `.vb`, `.asp`, `.aspx`, `.ascx`
*   **C / C++:** `.c`, `.cpp`, `.cc`, `.h`, `.hpp`
*   **Java:** `.java`
*   **TypeScript:** `.ts`
*   **SQL:** `.sql`

#### Query Types Reference

| Type | Description | Target | Options |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `search-features` | **Intent Search.** Find features/concepts using vector search. | Natural language query | `-limit` |
| `search-similar` | **Code Search.** Find functions semantically similar to a query. | Natural language or code snippet | `-limit` |
| `neighbors` / `test-context` | **Dependency Analysis.** Find immediate callers and callees. | Function Name (exact) | `-depth` |
| `hybrid-context` | **Combined.** Structural neighbors + semantic similarities. Great for refactoring. | Function Name | `-depth`, `-limit` |
| `impact` | **Risk Analysis.** What other parts of the system behave differently if I change this? | Function Name | `-depth` |
| `globals` | **State Analysis.** Find global variables used by a function. | Function Name | |
| `seams` | **Architecture.** Identify testing seams in a module. | (Ignored) | `-module <regex>` |
| `locate-usage` | **Trace.** Find path/usage between two functions. | Function 1 | `-target2 <Function 2>` |
| `fetch-source` | **Read.** Fetch the source code of a function by ID/Name. | Function Name | |
| `explore-domain` | **Discovery.** Explore the domain model around a concept. | Concept/Entity Name | |
| `traverse` | **Raw Traversal.** Explore graph relationships directly. | Node ID / Name | `-edge-types`, `-direction`, `-depth` |
| `status` | **Verification.** Check the git commit hash stored in the graph. | (None) | |

## Operational Guidelines
*   **Output Parsing:** The tool returns JSON. Parse it and present a concise summary (bullet points, mermaid diagrams, or tables).
*   **Exact Names:** Structural queries (`neighbors`, `impact`) require exact function names. Use `search-similar` first if you are unsure of the name.
*   **Context:** Always mention the source file and line number when discussing a function.
*   **Missing Data:** If a query returns empty, verify the spelling of the function/module name or try a semantic search.
