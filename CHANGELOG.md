## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-16
### Added
- **Web UI:** Added a dedicated "Tests" layer toggle to dynamically show or hide test components (files and functions) from the graph visualization.

### Changed
- **Web UI:** Enhanced the "Reset View" button to perform a full state clear and graph data reload instead of just resetting zoom coordinates.

## [1.3.339-beta] - 2026-04-14 [Pre-release]
### Fixed
- **RPG Pipeline:** Prevented pipeline crashes on meaningless feature data by filtering out non-semantic nodes (like tests and 'unknown' placeholders). Added structured output constraints and robust handling/jitter for transient LLM API errors (429, 500+).

### Changed
- **Documentation:** Dynamically update README instructions for the latest beta release via the release manager skill.

## [1.3.336-beta] - 2026-04-14 [Pre-release]
### Fixed
- **Python Parser:** Captured correct start/end line boundaries for AST nodes using tree-sitter definition blocks instead of just identifiers.

## [1.3.334-beta] - 2026-04-14 [Pre-release]
### Fixed
- **RPG Pipeline:** Resolved RPG feature extraction bugs (including directory context), variable-hop Cypher queries for navigation, and type assertion errors.
- **Testing:** Fixed the mock end-to-end testing environment missing Neo4j dummy credentials.
### Changed
- **Config & Docs:** Updated `.gitignore` rules for `.jsonl` and untracked binaries, and added explicit instructions for 404 model errors.

## [1.3.327-beta] - 2026-04-14 [Pre-release]
### Added
- **Python Parser:** Added Python parser support using tree-sitter, including class, function, inheritance, and import resolution extraction.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-14
### Added
- **Server Infrastructure:** Improved server startup feedback and diagnostic error reporting during initialization.

## [1.2.323-beta] - 2026-04-10 [Pre-release]
### Changed
- **Build Compatibility:** Updated the Linux build process to use Zig CC targeting GLIBC 2.28. This ensures the pre-compiled binary is compatible with a wider range of Linux distributions, including older versions of Ubuntu (20.04+) and Debian (10+).

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-31
### Added
- **Error Handling:** Improved Vertex AI integration to handle 404 Not Found errors as explicit hard failures. The CLI now provides users with immediate, diagnostic feedback and halts further agent execution when configuration issues (such as incorrect regions or missing projects) are detected.

### Changed
- **Documentation:** Removed redundant system documentation from this repository, as it is now managed within the `plan-commands` orchestration framework.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-27
### Added
- **UI Versioning:** Added a version display to the web UI footer, polling from a new `/api/health` endpoint to ensure consistency between the binary and the interface.
- **UI UX:** Enhanced the properties pane to support multi-line, full-width display for 'Atomic Features', improving readability for complex semantic clusters.
- **Architecture:** Introduced the `internal/progress` package to decouple UI progress state from core query and loader logic, successfully resolving long-standing circular dependencies.

### Changed
- **Logging:** Centralized query logging into a new `internal/logger` package. Cypher queries are now silenced in the terminal by default (directed to `io.Discard`) to prevent interference with interactive UI elements, but can still be captured via the `--log` flag.
- **Server:** Updated the `Server` struct and constructor to track and expose the binary version.

### Fixed
- **Circular Dependencies:** Resolved import cycles in the Neo4j loader and query providers by migrating shared progress tracking state to the new isolated `internal/progress` package.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-27
### Fixed
- **Query Hydration:** Fixed a bug in `GetNeighbors` where target node properties were omitted from the Cypher `RETURN` clause, resulting in `Unknown` labels and `null` properties in CLI/UI output.
- **C++ Resolution:** Improved symbol resolution in the C++ parser to allow name-based fallback when exact signature matches fail, preventing node fragmentation across files.
- **RPG Extraction:** Increased the source code truncation limit from 4,000 to 60,000 characters to ensure large functions (like `Auto_Plate`) are fully analyzed for feature clustering.
- **Search Resilience:** Upgraded semantic search to function as a Hybrid Search by including a literal fallback in the Cypher query (matching exact names or prefixes) alongside vector similarity scoring. Note: The API still correctly fails hard if the embedding model is completely unreachable.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-26
### Added
- **Documentation:** Mapped Michael Feathers legacy modernization workflows to GraphDB and detailed RPG granularity for complex God functions.

## [0.3.297-beta] - 2026-03-21 [Pre-release]
### Added
- **RPG Enrichment:** Implemented standardized progress reporting, replacing log-based output with interactive spinners and progress bars during LLM operations.
- **Analysis:** Added comprehensive research notes and metrics on RPG clustering behaviour and performance scaling.

### Changed
- **Testing:** Isolated database-dependent internal queries into an explicit `integration` build tag, allowing standard unit tests (`make test`) to run consistently without a local Neo4j container.

### Fixed
- **C++ Parser:** Corrected function call edge tagging and signature extraction logic to fix missing relationship data in the graph.
- **Testing Dependencies:** Cleaned up unused environment variables and Testcontainers imports across the testing suite.

## [0.3.290-beta] - 2026-03-19 [Pre-release]

- **Robust JSON Parsing:** Introduced `ParseLLMJSON` to better handle and strip markdown syntax, extra backticks, and whitespace from unstructured LLM responses.

### Changed
- **Documentation:** Archived inactive plans and renamed design documentation to `UX_DESIGN_OVERVIEW.md`.
- **Install Instructions:** Added specific instructions to README for pre-release version installation.

### Fixed
- Addressed silent feature extraction and summarization failures by failing fast and surfacing underlying context errors.


## [0.2.0-beta.3] - 2026-03-18 [Pre-release]
### Changed
- **Domain Clustering Quality:** Improved atomic feature extraction prompts to output domain-friendly, "Object-Action" (noun-first) descriptors rather than verb-centric descriptions.
- **DDD Naming Prompts:** Split Summarizer prompts into distinct "Domain" and "Feature" levels with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) naming guidance to avoid implementation-based names.
- **Enriched Node Context:** Enriched `NodeToText` with file path and function name for stronger structural and behavioral context during embedding generation.

### Fixed
- **Schema Mismatch:** Fixed `line` vs `start_line` schema property mismatch across all parsers and consumers, completely unblocking the feature extraction pipeline.

### Documentation
- Refactored `README.md` for Gemini CLI skill focus with simplified 1-line installation commands.
- Updated Scout agent and GraphDB architecture overview documentation.

## [0.2.0-beta.2] - 2026-03-17 [Pre-release]
### Changed
- **Pipeline Architecture:** Decoupled `Embedder` from the initial ingest phase, moving all high-fidelity embedding generation to Phase 3 (`enrich-features`). This speeds up ingestion, significantly reduces `nodes.jsonl` file bloat, and solves the overwrite bug.
- **Documentation:** Updated `GRAPHDB_OVERVIEW.md` and `README.md` to reflect the 6-phase pipeline architecture in detail.

### Fixed
- Fixed E2E test failures caused by un-mocked environment variable checks for `GEMINI_GENERATIVE_MODEL`.

## [0.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-03-17 [Pre-release]
